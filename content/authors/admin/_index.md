I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in John Hopcroft Center for Computer Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. From April 2018 to May 2019, I was a Research and Development Engineer in Baidu's search infrastructure team. Before that, I received my master degree from Beihang University in March 2018 and my bachelor degree from Southeast University in June 2015.
